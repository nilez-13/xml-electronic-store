				<Name> BenQ PD3200U </Name>
				<Item_number> 2 </Item_number>
				<Description>BenQ has added the PD3200U, a massive 32-inch Ultra HD display, to its Designer Monitor range. Intended for worker bees, the company has, seemingly by mistake, crafted a screen that gamers can enjoy wholeheartedly as well, so long as they can fit it on their desks. The PD3200U is best suited for creators. 3D designers, for instance, will be grateful for the inclusion of a CAD/CAM mode, while everyone else will revel in the factory-calibrated color accuracy and Rec. 709 adherence. </Description>

				<Name> Topre Realforce 87U Tenkeyless</Name>
				<Item_number> 5</Item_number>
				<Description> Made by the Japanese Topre Corporation, the Realforce is, as its name suggests, a force of nature in the keyboard world. It's all down to the Topre switches inside, which in contrast to Cherry's MX switches, are super smooth to type on and are often compared to playing weighted piano keys.
					Interface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: No | Switches: Topre electrostatic capacitive (30/45/55 grams variable, 45 grams, 55 grams)

				<Description> This 4TB drive is the largest model in the BarraCuda series, and while it’s not the biggest you can get – the BarraCuda Pro family goes up to 10TB – it should provide more than enough storage for personal use. It’s not the fastest disk out there, either: it uses just two 2TB platters, combined with 256MB of cache, to end up with read and write speeds of around 165MB/sec. </Description>

				<Name> Zotac Magnus EN1060 </Name>
				<Item_number> 8 </Item_number>
				<Description>The Zotac Magnus EN1060 is a perfect example of appearances being deceiving – while it’s essentially as small as the Apple Mac Mini, it’s exponentially more powerful, enough to even drive VR experiences. Sure, it’s a little outdated, rocking a 6th-generation Intel Core i5 CPU, but thanks to its small size and understated features, you can tuck this stealthy desktop under an entertainment center and pass it off as a gaming console.

				<Description>The Alienware Aurora R6 is an excellent gaming PC that offers brilliant performance in a conveniently compact body.

				<Name> Harman Kardon SoundSticks  </Name>
				<Item_number> 7 </Item_number>
				<Description> With four full-range drivers on each satellite, the speakers offer tremendous sound while remaining deceptively minimal. Even at lower volumes they were more than enough to fill the room with clear audio. You can even adjust the angle of the satellites to further optimize the sound direction. While the low-end performance of the subwoofer was slightly lacking in comparison to the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 speakers we tested, the exceptionally crisp audio from all types of music and game sounds made it difficult for us to pass up the SoundSticks.  </Description>
